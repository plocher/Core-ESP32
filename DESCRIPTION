Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen

A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.


ESP32 - Geekcreit WROOM dev board & SSD1306 I2C OLED - Matrix LED displays removed.


The 1.0 version integrated OLEDs were poor quality in practice; 2.0 brings
  * a different ESP32 - Geekcreit ESP32/Dev WROOM,
  * an external OLED - SSD1306 128x32 oe 128x64, which unfortunately covers the WiFi antennas and degrades performance.
  * external LED Matrix codeline displays with processor signals brought out to an RJ12 IO4 jack.
