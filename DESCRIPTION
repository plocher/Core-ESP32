Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen

A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.

  * Converted J6 - the Codeline RJ12 - to full IO4 (with 0.100 alternate...) since the [I2C-Codeline-Matrix](/pages/I2C-Codeline-Matrix) is now operational
  * Beefed up VIN traces to support higher prolonged current draws
