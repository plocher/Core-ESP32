Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen

A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.


Changes:


  * Moved OLED connector to not cover WROOM radio module
  * Added mounting holes
  * Moved top silkscreen items to not overlap
  * fixed bottom silkscreen location
