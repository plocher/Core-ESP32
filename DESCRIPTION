Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen

A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.


Same as v2.1, but using 0603 component footprints.
